    <p><h3><strong>Desrciption</strong></h3></p>
        <p><h5>
            Chicken Adobo is an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly recognized Filipino foods. 
            Not to be mistaken with Mexican adobo, this dish is uniquely prepared by stewing chicken in vinegar and soy sauce.
        </h5></p>

        <p><h5>Several sources who are experts in Asian food history say that the Filipinos were already cooking adobo even before Spanish colonization. 
            According to them, cooking with vinegar preserves the meat. 
            This method is also considered as one of the earliest food preservation practice.
